# Node.js Web Team Governance

The Node.js Web Team (`@nodejs/web`) is part of the Node.js Project and is composed of various specialized subteams, each with specific responsibilities and goals.

## TSC Oversight

Any website update that presents a position on global events or groups requires explicit approval from the [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/main/TSC-Charter.md#section-4-responsibilities-of-the-tsc). Approval can be requested by tagging `@nodejs/tsc` and waiting for seven days with no objections, or by emailing `tsc@iojs.org` and receiving at least one approval with no objections after seven days.

## Collaboration Among Web Team Subteams

The various subteams within the Web Team work collaboratively to create the best possible web experience for Node.js users. Each team’s distinct focus contributes to the overall goals:

- **Web Infra Team** manages the infrastructure, CI/CD, and technical framework.
- **Website Team** focuses on daily development and implementation.
- **UX & Design Team** advises on design, accessibility, and user experience.
